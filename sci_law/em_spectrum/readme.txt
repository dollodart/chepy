This script makes a graphic relating the parameters of an electromagnetic wave
using the equations 

E = h.𝜔
c = 𝜔.𝜆

Such graphics for classifying the electromagnetic spectrum abound. Both c and h
are constants, so scales relating E, 𝜔, and 𝜆 are given, as well as 1/𝜆, which
is popular to use as a horizontal axis erroneously called 'wavenumber' (having
dimension inverse distance) and being proportional to the frequency.

The electromagnetic spectrum is divided into bands depending on the discipline.
The general partitionings are by orders of magnitude, though to conform to
visible range of light some bands span more or less than an order of magnitude.
This choice of the order, 10, is arbitrary and based on our decimal arithmetic.
A more natural partitioning might be in base 2 for doublings, as this is the
smallest integral base. However, this would introduce far more bands. The
natural base could also be used, though its naturalness isn't really defined to
describing scale or magnitude, but instead such that the derivative or integral
of the exponential having it as the base is invariant. One can at least
understand that a factor of 10 corresponds to approximately 3 1/3 doublings.

Some examples of the classifications in different disciplines are: 

#. Physics
##. Ionizing and non-ionizing: Ionizing begins in ultraviolet

#. Chemistry
##. Vibrational Mode Absorption: Mid to far infrared.
##. Raman Absorption: Mid to far Infrared.
##. Electronic State Excitation: Visible to Ultraviolet

#. Electrical Engineering
##. Radio frequency: [10^4, 10^12] Hz

#. Medicine/Physiology
##. Visible: [400, 700] nm
##. UVA, UVB (relative damage to skin): [280, 400] nm

#. Residential
##. Microwave oven: 12.2 centimeters (an unfortunate choice of name, being far lower energy than micrometer wavelength)
##. Television (Satellite): [8.10^12, 20.10^12] Hz
