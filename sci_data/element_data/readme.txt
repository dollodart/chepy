Investigates the distributions and bivariate distributions of element data
(the latter are almost a linear relationship for many things of variances, and
the former are actually bivariate distributions using atomic number as an
independent variable, since this is not an arbitrary label but the number of
protons the atom has). 

Data source: taken from a freely available course website. Note there exists
an API for element data in the mendeleev package by Lukasz Mentel.
