Reference for the vapor pressures of metals, of particular use for
determining vacuum compatibility.  Pressure reported in reference in
atmospheres, temperature in Kelvins.

If one non-dimensionalizes temperature by the melting point and the
vapor pressure by the vapor pressure at the melting point, no universal
curve is obtained, that is, there is wide spread by each element on this
plot.  Because the vapor pressure is a thermodynamic property of the
condensed phase, on principle the law of corresponding states is invalid
as applied to it (this is not the case for non-idealities of the gas
phase to which the law of corresponding states is applied).
