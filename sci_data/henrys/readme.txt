Temperature dependent Henry's law constants for solutes in water over
a wide temperature range. Of particular interest is the sign inversion
in solubility, defined as the inverse Henry's constant, derivative with
respect to temperature. The solubility is non-monotonic in temperature
due to competing energetic and entropic factors in the liquid phase
relative to the gas phase.

Note that at higher temperatures sampled here, the water would boil at
standard pressure. However, one may still use the standard condition pressure chemical
potential function of oxygen and nitrogen to analyze the behavior. The
presence of water vapor as a a high pressure, high temperature steam doesn't
change the equilibrium between oxygen and nitrogen (which could be maintained
at 1 atmosphere partial pressures) and the liquid water. The research papers
cited in fact are precisely interested in solute behavior over a wide range of
conditions and near the critical point of the solvent.
