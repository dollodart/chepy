Minimum pressure is .59 MPa, which is about 5 times greater than atmospheric
pressure. This is because liquid nitrogen must be very cold to be in
equilibrium with atmospheric pressure, around 77 K. To run experiments on
viscosity, higher temperatures may be desired because the demand on
experimental apparatus is less, so the pressure is increased. Also, liquid
nitrogen handling systems likely use very high pressure to keep cooling costs
down. Temperature range is 66.5 to 123.4K. Pressure range is 1 to 20 MPa.
