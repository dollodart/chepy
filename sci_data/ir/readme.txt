Plots for IR modes (vibration/rotation) for gas phase molecules. 

Peak fitting and quantification are not done. See the Radis project, "A fast
line-by-line code for high-resolution infrared molecular spectra", among
others. A file reader for (one format of) the standard jmax file format for IR
spectrograph data is provided in the utilities.
