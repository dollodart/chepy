Processes thermodynamic data for heat capacities and for formation
enthalpies/formation gibbs free energies.

Some hydrocarbons, especially those with nitrogen heteroatoms, have
enthalpies and free energies of formation which are positive, meaning
equilibrium would favor dissociation into constituent elements at the
standard conditions of 298 K and 1 bar pressure. However that dissociation is
so kinetically limited at standard conditions that it is not observed.

Kopp's rule, an empirical rule in which heat capacities for elements add when
they are in compounds (regardless their bonding state) is consistent with a
correlation of heat capacity at standard temperature with number of atoms,
when using the heuristic that an R^2 > 0.9 indicates a meaningful statistical
correlation.  This correlation is not precise because the elements may differ
significantly in their heat capacities.

Koretsky. Units on coefficients for heat capacity are just inverse
temperature powers, since they give the non-dimensionalized
heat capacity (multiply the result by R in whatever units are
desired). Coefficients have power scale factors (see plot file). Units on
energies are kJ/mol.
