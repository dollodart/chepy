As one goes from alkali metals in the first group to non-transition metals in
the groups greater than 12 the Fermi energy increases. This is because the
number of electrons in the valence shell, which become valence and conduction
band electrons when atoms of the element are brought together, increases. The
ionization energy should correlate strongly with the Fermi energy, in fact, in
Proc. ESA Annual Meeting on Electrostatics 2008, Paper D2 a simple
semiclassical derivation shows the work function (highly correlated to Fermi
energy as shown) to be approximately half the ionization energy. Since
ionization energy follows the same trend of increase with increasing group
number, the result is in agreement with this expectation.

If one excludes relativistic metals (gold being the most extreme, copper also
being colored due to relativistic effects, and mercury and silver being
significant, as well), the R^2 value goes from 0.80 to 0.94, as shown. I do
not know of any physical meaning for the x-intercept of the correlation where
the Fermi level is zero and the work-function is non-zero.

Data sources: Fermi level data taken from hyperphysics for presumably equal
reference state (what this reference state is is not given). Work function
data from wikipedia.
