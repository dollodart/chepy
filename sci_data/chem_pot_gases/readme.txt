Calculates and plots thermodynamic properties of ideal gases as a function of
pressure and temperature from the Shomate equations.

Data source: Shomate constants are from NIST.

Standard pressure is 1 bar
Standard temperature is 298.15 K
Heat capacities in J/(mol*K)
Standard enthalpies in kJ/mol
Standard entropies in J/(mol*K)
Use a reduced temperature by factor of 1000 for Shomate polynomials (see
functional forms provided by NIST).
