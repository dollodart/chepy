Evaluates polynomials (with exponential factors) which are interpolating the
thermodynamic properties of K-type thermocouple material.  While I have not
seem them advertised as such, K-type thermocouples are interesting in that
their thermovoltage versus applied temperature relationship is very nearly
linear over a large range of temperatures.

Was also implemented as part of UHV-Chamber-Controls.
