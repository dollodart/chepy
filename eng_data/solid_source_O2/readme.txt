Calculations for the design of a solid-state source of oxygen for vacuum
systems. Thermodynamic calculations shows clearly the stability of reduced
forms of manganese oxide in the absence of an oxygen chemical potential (like
when used as a solid-state source of oxygen in a vacuum system for very low
partial pressure). Therefore it is possible to create the most oxidized form
of manganese oxide (e.g., by some kind of wet synthesis method under highly
oxidizing conditions), place it in an inert crucible such as silver in a
vacuum system, and thermally reduce the manganese allowing oxygen to diffuse
through the silver crucible. This will be an exceptionally pure source of
oxygen gas. The reaction kinetics and diffusion calculations are done in a
separate script from the thermodynamics.
