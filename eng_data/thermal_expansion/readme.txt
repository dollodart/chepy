One sees that polymers generally have higher thermal expansion coefficients
than metals, which have higher thermal expansion coefficients than ceramics,
though there is significant overlap between metals and ceramics. Chemically
one can classify much more granularly than simply metals metals, e.g., the
block or even the group in the periodic table if an element, or compound types
like oxide or halide if a compound.

With the thermal expansion coefficient and the modulus of elasticity one can
estimate the crack temperature for two pieces of dissimilar material initially
joined tightly at some temperature, in an ideal geometry (like bars) quite
easily. Assuming the elastic modulus is constant w.r.t. temperature, the crack
temperature is when the volume expansion due to heat is such that one of the
materials will reach its yield or fracture stress.
