Temperature dependent resistivities of metals. Note that the linear
approximation is usually invalid to extrapolate from room temperature to for
high temperatures of interest in, e.g., filament incandescence. This is
demonstrated for tantalum, though tungsten is more often used.

Data source: hyperphysics for linear temperature dependence coefficients. For
non-linear resitivity temperature trend of tungsten, see Milosevic, Vukovic,
Pavicic, Maglic Thermal Propertis of Tantalum Between 300 and 2300 K.
