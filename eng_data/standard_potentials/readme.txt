Data on the standard electrode potentials, which is the same data as in
activity series and what goes by other names.

Data source: wikipedia. The entries of the table are chemical equations which
need to be split into fields such as reactant element, valence charge, and so
on. Several packages, including Chempy by Bjorn Dahlgren, can parse chemical
equations like the ones in this data set and create objects representing them
which can be used in solving, e.g., equilibrium partition.
