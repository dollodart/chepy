The highly non-linear relationship is best captured in a log-log plot. I
created this for understanding the effect of gas on physical vapor deposition
chamber operating parameters, in particular, imposed voltage. The only value
compared to literature plots is the ability to calculate, in addition to
have a plot of, any part of the relationship.

Data source: Paschen's Law in Air and Noble Gases, L. F. Berzak, S. E.
Dorfman, and S. P. Smith. Units are 1/(m*mTorr) for A' and V/(m*mTorr) for B.
