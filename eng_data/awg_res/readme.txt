Resistances per units length for common metal wires whose size is specified in
American Wire Gauge. Given the metal resistivities temperature coefficients
(see chepy.eng_corr.metals_resistivities), one evaluate these for any
temperature.  The current purpose was, however, to compare room temperature
conductivity as a function of AWG size.
