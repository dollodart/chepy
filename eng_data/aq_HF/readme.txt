Mixing of HF in aqueous solution. Since the molar mass of HF and H2O are
similar the compositional variables are always similar. The active fraction of
HF is defined as that which is not dissociated into H+ and F- ions in the
solution, based on the acidity constant of HF and material balance. This shows
why higher concentrations of HF in aqeuous solutions are more dangerous.
Dissociated HF is no more dangerous than other acids, but associated HF has
its particular reactivity with calcium. Note, though, that even at .1
composition (molar and weight are nearly the same for HF), the fraction of
active HF is still .09. Because it is a weak acid, only at low concentrations
is a significant fraction dissociated, and so the majority of the reason there
is less danger for HF solutions of lower concentration is because of the lower
nominal concentration, not because of the trend of active concentration (which
again is nearly the same as nominal concentration of HF from 0.1 and up).
