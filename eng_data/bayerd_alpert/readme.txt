Relative sensitivity factors for the Bayerd-Alpert Ion Gauge, a type of hot
cathode gauge, for different gases. The relative sensitivity factor increases
with increasing molecular weight for the given gases, as expected by basic
chemical intuition that the atomic ionization energy decreases when going down
a group. Plasmas split molecules into constituent atoms and ionize them, so a
better measure might be the average atomic mass in the molecule (but it turns
out to be worse, perhaps because of the very different atomic masses of the
constituent atoms, especially for compounds containing hydrogen).

The highly variable chemical properties of the molecules in the dataset may
obscure correlations which exist within chemically similar groups. For example
the RSF is far better correlated with average atomic mass when looking only at
hydrocarbons and excluding hydrogen, with a correlation coefficient of 0.80. 

In noble gases, the correlation of molecular weight and RSF is 0.97, so high
that molecular weight may be the only factor to account for the differences
(or is perfectly correlated to a physically causal relationship, like
ionization energy).

Correlations could be extended to other molecular/atomic properties by
appropriate table joins.
