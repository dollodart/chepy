Plots the standard sizes of Allen keys. This does not follow a power law. This
means that not only is it not a geometric series in the diameter, but neither
is it a geometric series in any power of the diameter, such as the square
corresponding to cross-sectional area. A piecewise linear fit with two pieces
fits is excellent, the first piece with an R^2 of 1.0. There are
approximately 1/4 millimeter increments beginning from the smallest size to
around 5 millimeters, where then there is between 1/2 and 1 millimeter
increments.
