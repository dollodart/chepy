Analysis of screw dimensions. 

Th major diameter basic makes a piecewise geometric series. 

All of the given data are highly correlated with major diameter, even
subtracting out mean values either within a column or within a row (that is,
for a given screw size). This is as one expects, since the greater diameters
for a given screw have to be larger than the smallest diameter, and as a
matter of design there should be some relationships, as well.

Class 3A screws have no difference between the maximum and basic diameter,
unlike class 2A screws. In general, the differences between diameters is
increasing with size, but the fractional difference is decreasing with size.
The differences between diameters correspond to thread heights, so that while
thread height grows with screw diameter, it grows subproportionally. In
particular, the power law exponent on the diameter is around 0.44, which is
less than even a square root dependance.
