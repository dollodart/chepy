Over the entire range, including coarse meshes which are specified only by
their size in inches, the mesh size is approximately a geometric series. The
fractional increments are on average 0.85, equivalently, each mesh size is
around 15% smaller than the previous mesh size.

For mesh size versus mesh number, the correlation is well fit with a power law
showing a near linear relationship for the inverse in log-log coordinates (slope of -1.09).
The mesh numbers were evidently defined to reflect the exponential trend with
fractional increments of around 15%. For example, mesh size 40 is before mesh
size 45, and 40 / 45 = .888 which is near 0.85. In doing a linear correlation
of mesh size verse inverse mesh number, the slope is approximately 20 and the
intercept is nearly 0.
