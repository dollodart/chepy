Trends found are:

The tube diameter increments 17/20 of an inch for every inch the flange size
increases. This means the flange size grows faster than the nominal tube
diameter, thought not significantly. One might expect the rate of growth to be
same with the flange (having a constant offset because of the lip it needs).
But since the slope is less than 1, evidently the lip width needed increases
with increasing flange size. The constant offset (negative y-intercept) is
expected from the lip width (more precisely 2 times the lip width).

The number of holes is on average 12/5 the flange size in inches, but this is
a poor approximation. The mini CF has 6 holes and is only 1 1/3" in size.

The arc length between holes, except for the mini CF, is between 1 and 1 1/2".

Data source: MKS for CF flange dimensions. Sizes reported in inches. The
flange size is not a nominal size but the O.D. of the flange.
