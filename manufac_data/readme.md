A collection of manufacturing data I made during my research for understanding
or design of apparatus and facilities equipment. Power laws, and more
particularly geometric sequences, are commonly seen. Data has been gathered
from freely available sources, and includes some standards. Exhaustive
treatment is often not possible because of the cost of purchasing standards
which are not on the public domain.
