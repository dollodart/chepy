This analyzes the surface roughness resulting from standard sandpaper grits. 

The grit indexing corresponds roughly to an inverse power in the diameter
of the grit particles used. To a rough approximation, the diameter of the
particles in is related to the grit indexing by 

diameter/um = 20,000/x .

Those grits which are capable of polishing to optical smoothness are those for
which the surface roughness is below the wavelength (though more precisely,
half the wavelength) of the light applied.

The main thing of interest, on a physical basis, is the (average) diameter of the
particles on the sandpaper and the resulting surface roughness. This
correlation is, interestingly, neither linear nor a power law. It has a
distinctive s-curvature, which is beyond any first approximation. It's also
not clear that this relationship would be valid for all materials of differing
surface properties. Whether this is a physically expected relationship or
merely an artifact of using different data sources and data with limited
accuracy.
