Visualization of ground glass joint cross-sections. Ground glass joints are
used to make (with use of vacuum grease) gas-tight joins of glassware in
Schlenk line apparatus for small positive and negative gauge pressures (+/- 1
atmospheres). 

There is a large number of sizes and very few of them can be interchanged
because of the small taper ratio. When the diameter of a smaller piece is
intermediate to the diameter and the "end diameter" of the conical taper,
which occurs for 203 pairs of sizes, there is a partial fit, in which the the
male piece is inside the channel. This presumes that the extra length can pass
into whatever apparatus, but in 38 cases there will be a partial fit where
there is no extra length. Note that many of these fits will be edge cases,
e.g., the diameter of the male piece will be nearly the same size as the end
diameter and not seal well (a definite inequality is used to exclude when they
are the same).

Data source: Wikipedia article on Ground glass joint. "The first number
represents the outer diameter (OD) in millimeters at the widest point of the
inner (male) joint. The second number represents the ground glass length of
the joint in millimeters."
