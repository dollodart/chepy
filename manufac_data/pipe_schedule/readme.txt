Plotting and analysis of pipe schedule. 

Both the nominal pipe size and outer diameter are only roughly in geometric
series. The exponent in the power law is below 1, which may be understood as
'subgeometric' growth.

At large sizes the nominal pipe size and outer diameter converge. At small
nominal pipe sizes the outer diameter because significantly larger, because
the fraction of the outer diameter that is the pipe thickness becomes
significant. Annular ratios, the ratio of two times the thickness to the outer
diameter, in fact vary from a high of 70% to a low of 1.75%.

Pipe schedule thickness follows an approximate power law with nominal pipe
size, with an exponent between 1/2 and 1. Exceptions include pipe schedules
are constant thickness (STD and XS), and at large pipe sizes where the
thickness corresponding to a schedule remains constant. Those pipe schedules
over a greater domain of pipe sizes are less well fit by a power law.

The tendency to round to nearest fractional inch is greater when the
fractional change this rounding causes is smaller, that is, for larger pipe
schedules. This is as one expects, because the rounding to some unit (as a
fraction of an inch) is merely a convenience which is allowed by some
fractional tolerance.
