Analysis of the recommended seating toreques for ISO screws. The main finding
is the seating torque for a given grade of screw increases with the cube of
the diameter. There are theoretical relations between applied torque and
tension (axially along the screw) which predict a cubic relationship. In
particular, the torque applied is defined relative to the lever arm the torque
applier makes, but the lever arm of the screw grows linearly with the outer
diameter. In addition, the cross-sectional area grows as the square of the
diameter.

For a given clamp force, the equation for the required torque is all other
things constant linear with the diameter of the screw (see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolted_joint). Evidently the clamp force, then,
is specified to grow as the square of the diameter, and it is quite clear why
this would be: to ensure the same pressure (=normal stress) on the joint. 

The nut factors, assuming a preload (=clamping force) equal to the yield
stress, are found to be around 0.35. In practice one takes clamping
forces significantly below the maximum and nut factors generally range between
0.20 and 0.25.

"Mx" type screw is a screw with diameter of x in millimeters (this diameter is
the shank, not head). Torque units in data are in N*m.
