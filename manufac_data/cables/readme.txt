The purpose of this directory is to compare the specifications of different
types of electrical cable. Some of these ratings are per conductor or per pin,
so the net current can be significantly greater than reported. This informs the
need for boosters on USB cables used over long distances. Category 6 is clearly
the best networking cable and should be preferred for that application, but the
ubiquity of USB often makes it lower cost or more convenient.
