This directory investigates the geometric series for American wire gauge. The
logarithmic relationship found is gauge=20*log10(0.325 in./diameter). There
are the following three points:

1. D=0.00325 in. has a gauge of 40
2. D=0.0325 in. has a gauge of 20
3. D=0.325 in. has approximately a gauge of 0 (actually it is around 0.300 in., multiple zeros are used for higher sizes)

The logarithmic relationship which defines the gauge is also provided in
Wikipedia and here compared to the one derived. The inverse of the logarithmic
relationship is a power relationship, and is used here to avoid having to
compute (by change of base formula) the logarithm of a non-standard base. The
simpler relationship found here is easier to remember than the complicated one
which is in terms of peculiar integers (36, 39, and 92). The residual is no
more than 3% relative to the data (which is as accurate as the "definition"
provided). The residual is no more than .1% relative to the definition.
