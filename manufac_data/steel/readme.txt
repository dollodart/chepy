Chemical composition of various grades of stainless steel. Used for predicting
possible chemical interactions in stainless steel vessels. No analysis of the
mechanical properties of these steels or alloys is made here.

Chromium, nickel, and manganese are across alloys the most abundant nonferrous
metals.
