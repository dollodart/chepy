Chemical composition of various grades of stainless steel. Used for predicting
possible chemical interactions in stainless steel vessels. No analysis of the
mechanical properties of these steels or alloys is made here.

Chromium, nickel, and manganese are across alloys the most abundant nonferrous
metals. Nickel especially appears often in heterogeneous catalysis. But the
surface segregation of components in such complicated alloys is not
well-understood (as far as I know), and the surface area of steel components
in a reactor is generally so small that reaction on its surfaces would be
negligible even if the catalytic activity is relatively high.
