A plot of the relationship between flow rate, conductance, and pressure
drop as defined in the equation

Q=C*DeltaP,

where Q [=] pressure*volume/time and so ndot=Q/RT, or ndot expressed in
standard liters per second is Q/RT*RTstd/Pstd. If one takes standard
temperature, then ndot=Q/Pstd. It is therefore most convenient when Q is
expressed not as an energy but a pressure times volume with the pressure unit
as bar or atmosphere, which is near 1, so that the volumetric flow rate at
standard pressure can be easily read. However, convention usually reports in
torr liters per second, which requires division by approximately 760.

The value of plotting such a simple relationship is in showing what a given
conductance tells you in terms of the measurable variables of pressure drop
and flow rate. Pumping speeds on pumps can vary from 10 or so liters per
second, for the case of mechanical roughing pumps, to even several thousand
liters per second, for some diffusion pumps. Therefore the net conductance
that these pumps can support while still maintining UHV pressure can be
shown by such plots.
