Empirical equation for film thicknesses, when the films are at least 100 times
greater in height than they are thick. There is substantial theory on film
thicknesses using transport equations. When one doesn't consider surface
tension effects, the models can be quite simple (see, e.g., "The Draining of a
vertical plate" at 10.1017/S0305004100015437).

The purpose of this calculation was to determine how much oil was being used when
submerging and withdrawing parts, especially relative to manual application.
One can see that as an order of magnitude, a tenth of a teaspoon of oil is
left on a square inch.

TODO: there are currently three roots, when any physically meaningful solution
would have at most one root.
