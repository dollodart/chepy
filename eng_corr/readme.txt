Calculators for some engineering correlations, which may or may not be
provided with the data for which the correlation was made. These are not
always strictly correlations which depend on data, but more generally
relationships. They may be derived from physical equations. They contrast with
the data section in that the derivation is either theoretical, or when
empirical generalized to many classes of materials.
