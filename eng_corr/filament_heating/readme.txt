Estimates the lower bound on oxidation time for a tungsten filament. Note that
this lower bound is very conservative. If the sticking probability of molecular
oxygen is taken into account, even without diffusion or reaction barriers, the
lower bound increases by a factor of 10^5, since sticking probabilities are on
the order of 10^-5.

Also estimates the steady-state temperature and resistance of tungsten
filaments. Used for design of filament heaters. Assumptions such as
emissivity of 1 (black body) are not plausible, but emissivity data are
generally quite unreliable.
