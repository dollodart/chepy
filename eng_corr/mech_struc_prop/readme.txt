Reproducing structure-property relationships for different classes of
materials. This also enables quantification and for plots between different
variables than those provided by the source to be made. One can see that,
e.g., the density and melting point are positively correlated, even across
classes of materials.  A simple explanation, that materials will generally be
more dense the stronger (and therefore more closely packed) their bonding is,
may explain this. In particular, polymers melt at much lower temperatures
because it is not atomic bonds that are lost, but intermolecular ones
(cross-linked polymers will generally decompose before melting).

One can also see that the yield stress at a given (compressive) strength is
about an order of magnitude higher for ceramics than the yield stress at a
given (tensile) strength for non-ceramics. By the note in the provided
reference, since the compressive strength is 1 order of magnitude higher than
the tensile strength for ceramics, all materials follow a nearly an equality
for tensile strength and yield stress. This implies that strain hardening is
not a significant effect in most materials, that is, the strength and yield
stress are nearly equal. Since yield stress is necessarily less than or equal
to strength, it must appear to one side of the 1:1 line, as is also shown.

Though silicon is a ceramic, it's elastic modulus is similar to metals
(similar to that of copper alloys!). Its fracture toughness is orders of
magnitude lower and so it fractures, but for the small amount of deformation
which it may undergo before crack propagation and fracturing, it does so as
easily as a metal. This is important in semiconductor processing, especially
because silicon wafers are around 700 ùúám thick but can be 300 mm in diameter,
allowing them to deflect significantly in the direction perpendicular to the
plane of the wafer under low stress.  The yield strain for silicon is higher
than that for metals, at around 2.2% compared to 1.2%---it just fractures
before it reaches the yield point, generally. A perfect single crystal of
silicon strains twice as much and with the same elastic modulus as a metal,
leading to it being a stronger material. In general, ceramics are brittle only
because their fracture toughness is small, and perfect crystals subject to
quasistatically imposed loads are stronger than metals.

ceramic, and polymer, such as polymer foam, which has significant void space
